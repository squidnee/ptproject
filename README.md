A tool for exploring the neuroscience of brain disorders. The app presents a list of five brain and mental disorders (Alzheimer's, Major depressive disorder, etc.). If you were to click on a disorder, the parts of the brain (represented as 'nodes' corresponding to specific brain networks) will light up. You may click on the node to learn more about how that brain region has been shown to play a role in patients who have been diagnosed with the associated disorder.

To take a look at the app in action, clone this repo and run it through Flask by typing 'python app.py' into your Terminal.

Pardon the ugly HTML and CSS. This was for a class project and was not meant to be beautiful, though I might get around to refurnishing it if I see a reason to.
